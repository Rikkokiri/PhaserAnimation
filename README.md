# PhaserAnimation

This project started out as a simple assingment for a class (make a scrolling text and one effect with [Phaser](http://phaser.io)) and turned into about 50 second long animation sequence.

As instructed I used HTML game development framework [Phaser](http://phaser.io) to create the animation. Additionally I wrote some classes on top of the tools provided by Phaser to make the animation process eaier. Because I calculated and programmed the timing of each animation by hand, the music and the animation are not always perfectly in sync. Maybe some day I'll come back, fix that and extend the animation.

If you're curious, [check out the finished animation](http://rajala.me/PhaserAnimation/). Just have some patience and wait for a big white play button to appear (and then press it to play the animation).
